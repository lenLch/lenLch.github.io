### JOMO

### Quote
I was supposed to go to a party today, but instead, I went to the museum. And I'm experiencing JOMO.

### Meaning
joy of missing out; spending time alone instead of with friends.

JOMO is an acronym for joy of missing out and describes the pleasure of taking a break from social activity - especially social media - to enjoy personal time.

### Use
Andy was invited to a party, but he decided not to go. Instead, he wanted some time alone, so he went to the museum. He is having some wonderful JOMO.

JOMO, or the joy of missing out, means that you are having a great time alone. You friends might be doing something together, but you are happy without them. When do you experience JOMO? Do you enjoy being alone?

### Examples
I went to the beach alone and experienced JOMO.

Mary doesn't believe in JOMO. She is always with her friends!

Do you feel JOMO when you miss a party?
