### hang in there

### Quote
I wanted to encourage you guys to hang in there when it comes to speaking English because English is a hard language.

### Meaning
keep trying, don't give up hope

### Use
Today, Len wants to give encouragement to all students of English! She knows that English can be a crazy language, but it's also an amzing tool for making friends and getting a good job. She wants you to hang in there and not give up.

When you hang in there, you keep working and trying even when things are hard. You remember to be patient, especially with yourself! When did you need to hang in there? How do you remember to be patient?

### Examples
I know things are hard right now, but hang in there. It will get better.

My calculus class is so hard! My parents want me to hang in there, but I don't know if I can do it.

In a relationship, it's hard to know when to hang in there and when to call it quits.
