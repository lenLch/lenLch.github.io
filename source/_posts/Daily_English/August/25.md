### Napping

### Intro
It's the middle of the day and everything is going well. You are getting your work done and you feel great. But all of a sudden, you become extremely tired, and you don't feel like you can last for much longer. What do you do? Do you take a break and drink some coffee, or take a nap?

Many people find that napping leaves them feeling refreshed and full of energy. But some people feel like naps can interrupt their sleep pattern. All over the world, people have different ways to deal with sleepiness.

Gary loves napping but Sara feels like she can't take them.

Sara: (Yawns)

Gary: Oh, no.

Sara: I'm so tired, Gary...

Gary: Are you OK?

Sara: ...but I can't take a nap because it will interrupt my sleep pattern.

Gary: Oh, no. But how long do your naps usually last?

Sara: It's random, that's why I can't take a nap.

Gary: I love napping. I think it's great. I feel refreshed after I take a nap. And actually, it lets me take a break from the day to not think about anything.

Sara: If I take a nap, it will keep me up all night.

Gary: Oh, no. I've learned to schedule it so that I take a nap during lunch or maybe early afternoon so that it won't impact what time I go to sleep.

Sara: I guess I could try one, and just set my alarm, and maybe it will give me more energy.

### Discussion
Sara is tired, but she doesn't want to take a nap. She says napping can interrupt her sleep pattern, and make it so she doesn't have very much energy the next day. Sadly for Sara, napping affects her in a negative way.

Gary loves taking naps. He says he likes to schedule them in the early afternoon so that he can feel refreshed for the rest of the day. He likes to take a break from being so busy and enjoy a little sleep. Who can blame him?

Do you like napping? Why or why not?

### Grammar Point
**First Conditional**

Sara tells Gary that naps are bad for her sleep pattern. She says, "If I take a nap, it will keep me up all night." She uses the first conditional.

The first conditional is used to discuss things that *will probably happen in the future as the result of something else that happens in the present*.

The first conditional consists of **two clauses**, one with **If + simple present verb** and the second with **simple future verb**, as in, "If you do something bad, something bad will happen to you." Sara thinks that is she takes a nap, she will not sleep very well that night.

We can also use the first conditional to make predictions about the future. For example, we can predict that "If my brother crashes the car tonight, my mother will be angry."

Which is correct, "If I don't eat, I was hungry," or "If I don't eat, I will be hungry"? (对)
