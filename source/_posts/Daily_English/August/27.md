### Learning to drive

### Intro
When work or school is stressful, there's nothing better than hitting the open road for a vocation. It feels great to choose where you want to go, turn on your favorite music, and just start driving. You don't even have to pack a bag. The only thing you really need is your driver's license.

Getting your driver's license is not the easiest thing to do. It can feel complicated when you're learning how to drive a car and the "rules of the road" at the same time. But after you finish, your life will be much more independent than it was before. Think of everything you'll be able to see and do!

Who doesn't have his driver's license? The answer may surprise you.

Brian: Gray.

Gary: Yeah.

Brian: I just enrolled in driver's ed, and it is so boring.

Gary: Is it really?

Brian: I don't think it's worth it.

Gary: I'll tell you...hitting the open road, all by yourself...there's nothing like it, Brian.

Brian: I don't know. It seems really complicated. The teachers are so worked up, and it's so stressful.

Gary: It is really stressful. All the horns, all the lights, all the rules.

Brian: I don't think I can multitask like that.

Gary: You just have to develop the skill, Brian. It just takes time. Keeping practicing. You'll be great!

Brian: I really am looking forward to being a little more independent, so I guess I'll be up for the challenge.

Gary: Yeah, yeah. You can go out to the coast, you can go up to the mountains, you could go get your groceries. It's just so much easier when you've got your car and your driver's license.

Brian: That's true. I'm going to try and tough it out.

Gary: We can go practice together.

Brian: Really?

Gary: Yeah.

Brian: Oh, thanks. That sounds great.

Gary: Sure, man.

### Discussion
Brian doesn't know how to drive, so he's taking a driver's ed class. The class is both boring and stressful, though, so he's not sure it's the right place for him. While Brian wants to learn how to drive, he's not sure if he wants to continue going to class.

Gary wants Brian to be successful, so he tries to make his friend feel better. Gary says that even though driving is difficult to learn, Brian will be happy when he can do it. He believes that it's great to be independent and able to go wherever you want. Gary even offers to practice with Brian.

### Grammar Point
**Conjunctions**

Brian says, “I just enrolled in driver’s ed, **and** it is so boring.” He uses a conjunction.

A conjunction is a word that joins two or more words, phrases, or clauses. There are three kinds of conjunctions: coordinating, subordinating, and correlative.

There are only seven coordinating conjunctions. They are for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so. Coordinating conjunctions join together parts of a sentence that are the same. For example, “Would you like pie or cake?” or, “John likes taking walks and riding his bike.”

Coordinating conjunctions can also join two independent clauses. For instance, you might say, “I love coffee,” and also, “It makes my stomach hurt.” You can join these clauses with a conjunction, saying, “I love coffee, but it makes my stomach hurt.”

Brian uses the word and as a coordinating conjunction. He joins the two clauses “I just enrolled in driver’s ed” with “It is so boring” to say “I just enrolled in driver’s ed, and it is so boring.”

Subordinating conjunctions allow us to join independent clauses with adverb clauses. For example, “I will bring dessert unless you are baking a cake,” or, “I cry whenever I watch that movie.” Other common subordinating conjunctions are although, because, before, if, since and while, but there are many more!

Correlative conjunctions are used in pairs and have the same function as coordinating conjunctions. For example, “Both Nate and Amy work at the library,” or, “Either Mom or Dad will pick you up from the airport.” In addition to both… and and either… or, other common correlative conjunctions are neither…nor, not… but, whether…or, and not only… but also.
