### Idioms

### Intro
Learning a new language can be fun, but also incredibly difficult. There are always so many rules! The whole process can be really confusing. But one thing that every language has is idioms.

Idioms are phrases that describe something different than what the original words say. For example, a common idiom in English is "It's raining cats and dogs." Of course, cats and dogs are not actually falling from the sky. It just means that it is raining really hard.

Gary and Sara wonder where idioms come from.

Gary: About a week or two ago, I was watching a soccer game, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire game. It was so exciting!

Sara: Where did that come from, "edge of my seat"? What is that?

Gary: I don't know. It's this funny idiom, right?

Sara: Idiom. What are other examples of idioms?

Gary: "Don't pull my leg."

Sara: "Kick the bucket."

Gary: They're so confusing sometimes. I bet a lot of non-native speakers think it's just a silly sentence that someones has said, and...

Sara: It's possibly very hard to understand.

Gary: Yeah.

Sara: And there are countless idioms.

Gary: There really are. I try not to use them, but sometimes it's the perfect way to describe how I feel.

Sara: It's true. And it's a natural part of how we speak.

Gary: It is! Wow. I'm going to be thinking about that much more often now.

Sara: I will be on the edge of my seat.

### Discussion
Gary tells Sara that when he was watching a soccer game last week, he was on the edge of his seat. Gary uses an idiom without even realizing it! He thinks idioms can be confusing, but he admits he uses them a lot.

Sara is a little confused about what idioms are and where they come from. Together, she and Gary come up with a couple more idioms and realize that they use idioms every day. She just hopes non-native English speakers can understand her.

What is an interesting idiom from your country?

### Grammar Point
*Future Progressive Tense*

Gary and Sara realize they use a lot of idioms when they speak. Gary says, “Wow. I’m going to be thinking about that much more often now.” He uses the future progressive tense.

The future progressive tense is used to talk about something that is definitely happening in the future. It is formed with will be + main verb + ing, as in, “I will be staying with my parents over the summer.” This form doesn’t change regardless of the subject. It is the same for I, you, he, she, it, we, and they. For instance, you can say, “He will be staying with his parents over the summer,” or, “We will be staying with our parents over the summer.” In the future, Gary will continuously think about using idioms a lot more.

The negative form of this tense is won’t be + main verb + ing, as in, “She won’t be coming tonight.” You can form a question like this: “Will she be coming tonight?” or “Will they be staying with their parents over the summer?”

Often the future progressive can be used in the same way as simple future tense. You can say, “When will you be leaving for Paris?” or “When will you leave for Paris?” Both of these sentences are correct.

Which is correct, “I will be watching the game tonight, :heavy_check_mark: ” or, “I will be watch the game tonight”?
