### Ghosting

### Intro
You're dating the perfect girl. She's beautiful, intelligent, and funny. You like the same music, foods, and hobbies. Your friends thinks she's great, and your parents do, too. It feels like a dream because everything is going so well. You even start thinking about having a home and a family with her.

Then one day, she doesn't reply to your texts. Or your emails. It seems strange, so you call her phone. She doesn't answer. You go to her apartment, but she doesn't answer the door, either. After two days, you realize she's being a coward. She wants to break it off. She could be up front and direct, but that's not her M.O. She's ghosting you.

Jessica: I just heard that Charlize Theron was ghosting Sean Penn. Have you ever been ghosted?

Romeo: I've never been ghosted, but I've ghosted someone.

Jessica: You have?

Romeo: Yeah. I had to ghost her! She was to possessive.

Jessica: I didn't even know what what ghosting meant. I didn't know that people ghosted each other.

Remeo: It is kind of a coward move, but sometimes it's better just to leave things unsaid.

Jessica: I disagree. That is so not my M.O. If I wanted to break it off with someone, I would just be direct and tell it like it is.

Romeo: What if they were a stalker?

Jessica: That would get kind of scary. I guess you have a point. I still feel more comfortable trying, at least, to be up front with somebody if I wanted to break up with them. But you're right... If they started stalking me, then it would get a little scary.

Romeo: Yes, I agree.

### Discussion
Jessica just learned about ghosting. She knew that people do it, but she didn't know that there was a word for it. To Jessica, ghosting is a bad idea. She prefers to tell someone that she's dating if the relationship isn't working for her. She doesn't like the idea of not answering someone's texts, emails, or calls.

Romeo actually has experience with ghosting someone. He was dating someone who was very possessive, and he thought it was better to ghost her than to be direct. Romeo thinks that ghosting can be safer than being up front, especially if you're dating a person who could be a stalker.

How do you feel about ghosting? Would you ghost someone, or has someone ghosted you?

### Grammar Point
Articles(冠词), Quantifiers(量词), Determiners(限定词)

Jessica says: '... if they started stalking me, then it would get a little scary.' She uses a quantifier.

Articles, quantifiers, and determiners are the little words we use before nouns. When you see the words a, an, and the, you know that a noun will follow them. These words are articles. Words such as each, every, either, neither, much, enough, which, what, some, and any also mark nouns.

Quantifiers come before nouns and tell us how many or how much of something. These words include many, a few, much, a little, plenty, a lot, some, and enough. For example, "There are enough cookies for everyone," and, "I saw a couple of horses in the field." Using a little, Jessica explains how scary it would feel to her if someone began stalking her.

The words some and ant are determiners. They always come before nouns or noun pharses. We use any in negative sentences, for example, "We are not allowed to have any pets in our apartment." And we use some in positive statements, such as, "It is OK to use reference books for some exams." When used as a determiner, some means certain or specific.

Which is correct, "I can't eat some peanuts or I'll get sick," or "I can't eat any peanuts or I'll get sick :heavy_check_mark: "
