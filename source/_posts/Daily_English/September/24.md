### Nannies

### Intro
Being a mother is a full-time job. Sometimes, it's even too much for one person to handle, especially if she's already working another job. Day care is one option for moms who need help with their kids. Another option is nanny.

Nannies can help moms who are overwhelmed by how much work raising kids takes. A nurturing indivdual can love someone else's children, cook, and even clean the house so that the mom can have a break, or in some cases, work at her other job.

Parents want to make sure their kids are safe, though, so references are important when they're looking for a nanny. Not anyone can take care of somebody else's children.

Why are Marni and Jeff talking about nannies?

Marni: Jeff, I am so overwhelmed being a new mom. You know what I really want?

Jeff: Well, I have a few guesses, but...

Marni: A nanny! I used to work as a nanny, and I have so much respect for nannies. And now as a parent, I see the value. Society may view it as a cop out, like I'm supposed to be there every moment, but I just can't handle the responsibility at times. I need a break!

Jeff: I don't blame you. That's a stressful job. My girlfriend actually used to be one, and an old roommate used to be one.

Marni: It takes a certain person to be a nanny.

Jeff: It does.

Marni: And you want that nurturing, caring person that has an attachment with your children. And I have an attachment with my children. If they would still be interested in nannying. I'd like some references.

Jeff: Oh, yeah. I can give you their info.

Marni: That'd be great.

### Discussion
Marni shares that she has too much work as a new mom. She loves her daughter and wants to care for her, but sometimes, it's just too much work! She wants a nanny.

Jeff isn't actually surprised by Marni's wish. He knows a couple people who used to be nannies. In fact, Marni used to be a nanny also. Both Jeff and Marni agree that it's one easy job to be a nanny or a mother.

Marni asks Jeff if the people he knows still want to work as a nannny. She needs some references right away, so she can get some help.

Did you have a nanny? What do you think about nannies?

### Grammar Point
Used to be vs Be used to

Marni tells Jeff that she used to work as a nanny. It's easy to confuse used to do and be used to. Both forms look alike, but they have very different meanings and structures.

First let's look at used to do, or used to + verb. When I say I used to do something, I mean that I did something regulary in the past which I no longer do now. For example, "When I was a child, I used to fight with my brother, but now we get along."

We can also use used to do to talk about something that was true in the past but is not true now. For example, "Playing with dolls used to be Sarah's favorite activity." In other words, Sarah's favorite activity in the past was playing with dolls, but it is no longer something she likes to do.
