### Dive Bars
廉价酒吧

### Intro
It's time to go grab a beer! Do you want to go somewhere new, clean, and expensive, or would you prefer a *grungy* and cheap dive bar with an old school *ambience*?

Many people don't understand the *appeal* for a dirty bar, but that's probably why so many *eclectic* people end up going to them. Dive bars often have an interesting underground scene, so don't be surprised if you see a few hipsters there.

Sara wants Brian to come with her to her favorite dive bar.

</audio>

Sara: I am going to my favorite dive bar. Would you like to come with me?

Brian: Is it all grungy?

Sara: It is! But that's part of the appeal...the eclectic people, and the underground scene, the grungy ambience.

Brian: Are there going to be a lot of hipsters there?

Sara: There might be. But this particular dive bar is more old school.

Brian: OK. I've got to say, I do love a good dive bar now and then. Main question, is it going to be cheap?

Sara: It will be cheap. There is a jukebox, so you can play your favorite songs and sing along when it gets later at night.

Brian: That sounds great. Do they have booths? Because I love sitting in grungy booths at dive bars.

Sara: There are booths. Red pleather booths.

Brian: All right. I am ready to go, then.

Sara: Great!

### Discussion
Sara is going to her favorite dive bar tonight. She likes it because it has eclectic people and a grungy ambience. She wants Brian to come, so she tells him that there are red, pleather booths.

Brian likes dive bars, but he only wants to go to ones that do not cost very much money. He doesn't like hipsters very much, either. But once Sara tells him that her favorite dive bar has booths, he agrees to go. Brian can be so funny sometimes.

Do you like dive bars? What do you like to do when you go out?

### Grammar Point
**There, Their and They’re**

Brian wants to know what the people are like at Sara’s favorite bar. He asks, “Are there going to be a lot of hipsters there?” He uses the adverb there.

It can be very confusing to know when to use there, their, or they’re. Here are some helpful tips:

There is used to tell or show where something is, to refer to a place. For example, “There is a coffee shop down the street,” or, “The grocery store is over there.” Brian wants to know if many hipsters will be at a specific place.

Their is a possessive adjective. Possessive adjectives are used to show ownership, or what belongs to whom. As an example, “The children are wearing their boots,” or, “They drink their tea with sugar.”

They’re is a contraction of they + are. For example, “They’re going to Paris this summer,” or, “I don’t know if they’re coming with us.”

Which is correct, “They’re staying there tonight :heavy_check_mark:,” or, “There staying they’re tonight”?
