### on the same page

### Quote
What to eat right now for dinner? I was thinking pizza. (And I was thinking `lentils`) Clearly, we're not on the same page.

### Meaning
sharing the same thoughts or ideas; in agreement

### Use
Kat and Heather are trying to decide on dinner. Kat wants pizza, but Heather wants lentils. They are not on the same page. Because of this, they will need to keep discussing their options until they agree.

When you are on the same page as another person, you agree. You have the same idea, or you want to do something in the same way. How often are you on the same page as your friends? What do you do when you disagree?

### Examples
It was so easy to get this project done because we were all on the same page, and everyone knew what to do.

Margarent and Alex disagree about everything. They are never on the same page.

I'm glad we're on the same page about where to go on vacation this year.
