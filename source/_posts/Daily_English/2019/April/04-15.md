### catnap

### Quote
Because I’m feeling really tired, I think I’m going to take a catnap before I do anything else… for a little bit, just so I can be energized again.

### Meaning
short, light rest; quick sleep

<!-- more -->

### Use
It’s a busy day for Kat, and she has already done many things. Before she continues her projects, she needs a rest… but just a short one. She plans to take a catnap so she has the energy to continue her work.

A catnap is a short, light rest. You might not even fall asleep during a catnap, but you will feel just a little better after you close your eyes. When do you take catnaps? Do you feel refreshed after only a little sleep?

### Examples
I need more sleep than just a catnap!

Take a catnap, and then you will be ready to go out for the night.

Mary had just enough time for a catnap before her class.
