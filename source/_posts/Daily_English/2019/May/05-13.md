###  keep tabs on

### Quote
My fish has been acting a bit weird lately. So, I think I'm going to keep tabs on him.

### Meaning
watch someone or something regularly; monitor a situation

### Use
Kat got a new fish tank for her fish, but the fish has been acting strange. Kat is worried about her pet, so she is keeping tabs on him. She checks on him regulary to make sure he is OK.

To keep tabs on something is yo monitor it. You watch regulary to see if there is any change, either for good or for bad. When was the last time you had to keep tabs on someone or something? Are you good at mobnitoring things?

### Example
Can you keep tabs on the kids while I shop?

I need to keep tabs on my cat this week. She just had surgery(手术). 

Do you ever feel like someone is keeping tabs on you and watching your every move?
