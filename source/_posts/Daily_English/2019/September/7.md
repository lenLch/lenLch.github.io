### Karaoke

### Intro
Everybody thinks about being famous in one way or another. Maybe you think it would be cool to be a professional soccer player. Or perhaps an actor. Most of us will never know what it's like to actually be in the spotlight, but karaoker lets everybody pretend to be a famous singer.

Karaoke is a carefree way for anybody to be belt out his or her favorite tune, without needing much talent. One simply needs to choose a song that they like and sing along. It's that easy!

Len is going to sing karaoke tonight.

Sara: Guess what?

Brian: What?

Sara: I'm going to sing karaoke tonight with some friends. Do you want to come with?

Brian: No, karaoke isn't really my thing.

Sara: You don't like karaoke?

Brian: No, I'm not one for sing-alongs. I always feel like I'm in the spotlight, and I don't really like that. It always makes me feel uncomfortable.

Sara: But it's so carefree and fun! You don't need a lot of talent; you just go up there and belt out your favorite tune.

Brian: I feel like they only have a lot of pop songs, and they don't have a lot of music I would want to sing along to.

Sara: OK. Maybe we can find a place where there are private rooms for karaoke.

Brian: I do like going out with friends, so I'll come. I can't promise I'm going to sing anything.

Sara: Great! I'm so excited. I'm so glad you're coming with us.

### Discussion
Sara is going to sing karaoke with some friends tonight. She thinks karaoke is fun because it is so carefree, and she likes to sing along with her favorite pop musicians. She admits that she doesn't have much talent for singing, but that won't stop her from going!

Brian doesn't like singing karaoke very much. He says he gets nervous being in the spotlight. But Sara suggests that they could sing somewhere that has private rooms, so Brian agrees to go.

### Grammar Point
*Simple Future Tense*

Sara is telling Brian about her plans for the evening. She says, “I’m going to sing karaoke tonight with some friends.” She uses the simple future tense. 

We use the *simple future tense* to talk about things that will happen at a time later than now.

Using be going to is one way to form the simple future tense, as in, “I am going to watch a movie tonight.” Or, in Sara’s case, “I’m going to sing karaoke.” Another way to form the *simple future tense* is with will, as in, “I will see you soon.”

In some situations, like when you’re making a prediction about the future, you can use either be going to or will. But to talk about something that’s already planned or decided, it’s best to use be going to, as in, “I’m going to watch a movie later. Want to watch it with me?”

Which is correct, “Jessica going to play soccer tomorrow,” or, “Jessica will play soccer tomorrow” :heavy_check_mark: ?
