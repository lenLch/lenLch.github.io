### Mani Pedis

### Intro
When you're having a difficult day, what makes you happy? Maybe all you need is a hug or a piece of chocolate. Some people prefer a cup of tea, or even a glass of wine. Another way to feel better is to pamper yourself. Go on... be a little self-indulgent. Take yourself to the spa!

Getting a manicure or pedicure can make your hands and feet look like new. Or get both! A man pedi is the prefect beauty treament. When you let a professional exfoliate your skin, or cut and painy your nails, you can leave the spa glowing. Some people enjoy the experience so much that it becomes a ritual.

Jessica: I just got a manicure and a peducure, and it looks awesome.

Romeo: Nice.

Jessica: I thought that I would pamper myself a little bit.

Romeo: You did the spa, too.

Jessica: Yes, I did. Can you tell? Am I glowing?

Romeo: Don't hate, exfoliate.

Jessica: Honestly, I used to think that mani pedis were a little self-indulgent, but it's kind of relaxing. I could get into this.

Romeo: The most I've ever done for a oedi was cut my own toenails.

Jessica: Oh, really?

Romeo: And wash them, if that is considered a pedicure.

Jessica: Well, I've heard a lot of guys actually really enjoy the spa experience of going and getting their toes done.

Romeo: Yeah, they call that "metrosexual".

Jessica: Exactly.

Romeo: And it's a waste of money.

Jessica: Oh, you should try it. You might like it.

Romeo: I may, but I'm not going to make a ritual out of it.

Jessica: I probably shouldn't, either. It does get a little expensive.

### Discussion
Jessica is very happy with her mani pedi. She wanted to do something nice for herself, and she clearly chose the right treat. Jessica usually cuts and paints her own nails, but since the experience was so relaxing, she might go to the spa again.

If Romeo was metrosexual, he might join Jessica at the sea. But Romeo thinks that getting one's nails done is too self-indulgent. He's not saying that he will never get a manicure or pedicure, but it doesn't sound likely that Romeo will be getting one anytime soon.

Have you ever gottem a mani pedi? Would you get one again?
