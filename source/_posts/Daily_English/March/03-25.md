### if you must

#### Quote
So, I don't really like it when people give me cute nicknames. I like my real name. 
But if you must give me a nickname, I prefer the name Dom

#### Meaning
used to suggest the best way to do something one does not want to be done; 
used when people insist on doing a thing.

<!-- more -->

#### Use
Lots of people like to give their friends nicknames, but Len likes he real name best. 
He doesn't really want a nickname, but he knows people will give her one anyway. 
If they must give him a nickname, he wants them to call him Lance...and only Lance.

When a person says, "If you must...," it is a sign that they don't really want you to do something. But they know you want to do it, so they are giving you a suggestion about how to do it.  
When might you used this expression? Do your friends sometimes do things that bother you?

#### Examples
If you must play your music, please play it quietly.

Make sure you call her before 9 p.m. if you must call her.

If you must drive in the snow, please drive carefully.
