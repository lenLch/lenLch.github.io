### Brainstorm

### Quote
I'm trying to brainstorm ideas for my project that I have coming up, but I can't think of anything

### Meaning
quickly think of new ideas, often with a group of other people

### Use
There is a big project coming up in one of Kat's classes. She needs an idea to focus on, so she is trying to brainstorm and think of as many possible as she can, but she is having trouble thinking of fun ideas.

When you brainstorm, you write down or record many ideas. It doesn't matter if they are good or bad ideas. A brainstorm is not a final choice. It's just a way to think of as much as possible quickly. When do you brianstorm? Is it easy to or difficult for you to think this way?

### Example
We're going to brainstorm a new band name tonight.

Heather had to brainstorm ideas for her Creative Writing class.

How's your career brainstorm going?
