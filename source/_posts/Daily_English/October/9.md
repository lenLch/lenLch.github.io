### Cologne

### Intro
Wanting to smell good or `alluring` in nothing new. As long ago as the time of the `Egyptains`, people have been imporving how they smell with flowers, `herbs`, and oils. Whether the `scent` is something people can barely notice, or whether it's `over the top`, there are perfumes and colognes to fit everyone's taste and style.

People disagree on when it's OK for someone to start wearing a scent. In some cultures, when teenagers reach `puberty` they are permitted to use cologne. In others, the `mystique` of cologne is only for adults. Wearing it certainly sends a message, but what kind of message it sends depends a lot on the person wearing it.

Does Gary use cologne? What does Jessica think of men who wear it?

Jessica: Hey, Gary.

Gary: Yeah.

Jessica: Do you wear cologne?

Gary: `On occasion`, I do.

Jessica: Do you?

Gary: I do. I've got a few at home. And the way I wear it, you barely even notice that it's there.

Jessica: Oh, that's good.

Gary: Like one `spray`, and that's about it. Not even a full spray.

Jessica: So, it's not too over the top.

Gary: Oh my goodness, no. I don't smell like a `locker room`. No.

Jessica: Oh my gosh. Sometimes when men wear too much cologne, it makes me `gag`.

Gary: I can understand that. Though I'm guessing that a little bit of a cologne is alluring. And there might be this curious, wondering of a mystique in terms of, "Oh. What? Did I smell that?"

Jessica: Yeah, I can agree with that. Although it does make me laugh when I see younger kids wearing cologne when they're going through puberty. That's a little young to be wearing cologne.

Gary: And they put on way too much.

Jessica: Exactly. So, a little is good.

### Discussion
Jessica and Gary are discussing cologne. Gary uses it sometimes, but only in small amounts. He explains that he only wears enough cologne to get someone's attention, but definitely not so much that it's very strong. He doesn't want to smell like a men's locker room!

It sounds like Jessica is not very interested in smelling cologne on men. It's not very alluring to her, and sometimes it makes her feel like she's going to get sick. Jessica can agree that a small quantity is OK. She points out that teenage boys, especially, have a way of wearing way too much.

Do you wear cologne, or does your boyfriend or husband? What's your opinion of cologne?
