### facial
/ˈfeɪ.ʃəl/
美容
### Quote
I really like how my face feels after I do a facial. It's really smooth, and glowy, and just soft.

### Meaning
deep clean of the face; special spa treatment

### Use
Dominique took some time for herself today. She decided to do a facial. She cleansed her face with special products and covered her skin with a healthy mask. Now, her face feels refreshed!

A facial is a special cleansing routine for the face. It deeply cleans the pores and leaves your skin feeling soft. Have you ever had a facial? Do you like to take time for skin treatments like this?

### Examples
My mom and I always get a facial to celebrate summer.

Wow! Mary's skin looks great after her facial.

Do you do facials at home, or do you go to spa?
